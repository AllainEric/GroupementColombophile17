Adds a reset button to each section in the customizer

== Description ==
= Reset Customizer =

This plugin lets you reset a section of customizer settings without losing settings in other sections. Settings are not saved until you click "Publish" in the customizer.

Reset buttons are injected into each section of your customizer. The settings in a section are cleared and the preview window is refreshed when the reset button is pressed.

Entire sets of customizer modifications for a particular theme can be downloaded (backup as JSON data) and / or deleted.

You can then choose to restore a set of customizer modifications to the active theme. This can be useful if you want to migrate theme modifications from a child theme to a parent theme.

View active theme mods and choose to delete individual mods.

== Installation ==

2) Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
